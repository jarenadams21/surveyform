# surveyform
Introductory First Project to HTML/CSS using freeCodeCamp

Modeled after the introductory survery form project available on freeCodeCamp, and using information relevant to Sandbox @ NEU.
I am trying to familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, and JS before applying as a Developer, and I decided it would be cool to create
a form relevant to Sandbox.
